KLEJNOT MEETING NOTES
16. 4. 2025
i'm not good with note
present:
Miš, Shiloh, Nudl (and šauška later)

Miš explains how to use Obsidian for the game design doc, which they have already set up
-Github needs an account and Nudl doesn't want to make accounts lel
Obsidian kinda epic

put all notes in the "Fleeting" category, essentially it's the "scribbles" page

pages are nicely linked, or if you know where to go, ctrl-o to search directly

if you're gonna use fleeting, you don't need to actually use it, you can take the notes anywhere and LINK it there, then Miš will make them useable/parsable

not everything will be on obsidian, such as story, which is probably gonna be in separate documents, obsidian will have general notes for the programmers to be able to refer to it (sepravi ne na dolgo)

MOVING ON TO STAGES AND PHASES OF THE GAME

exploration, combat, social
treat each one as a separate element, which will be slotted together afterwards

planning - basic stuff, whatevers

explaining pre-production - figure out as much as possible before we begin, like npr lvl editor

game design doc won't be changed much after this point

afterwards production and testing, if it doesn't work in these stages, we jump back to pre-production to figure out what doesn't work

Miš will be working on design in tandem with Shiloh, Nudl will be doing concepts

MOVING ON TO SUMMARY
title, main art, tagline

see: inspirations page on Obsidian doc

DESIGN PILLARS, MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE GAME (also in notes in Obsidian)
we must set up 3-6 of them, so that we keep to them as we make the game and they define the core of the game experience

-Šauška joins lol

Shiloh is the main decision maker when it comes to the pillars

Pillars outlined:
1: Interactive World
2: Discovery/Exploration

Miš sets up OBS to record lol

3: Oppressive World
-Shiloh: "i want the world to LOOK unconquerable but it should not be"
-"carving your space in the world"
-gritty

4: Agency
-solving problems in many ways, depending on player

if we want to change them, we should change them as soon as possible, later it won't be possible
Miš will reword them a little bit

----
HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY
the general idea is: you're a person delivering stuff settlement to settlement underground, and shaping the world to make these tasks easier

CAMERA - COMPLETE TOPDOWN

SETTING
rat people (at least the protagonist), post-apoc (post-human), caves and tunnels/mines/subways... every settlement is its own city state with very different governments, settlements are very isolated

some random bits/quotes from the convos:
the paths are inherently dangerous
"the way government action can guide public services"
"WOLT society"
"due to pressures from rich people, the govt stopped making post services, everything fell into disrepair"
"you don't have an inventory, you're just pushing a cart around"
"elevators, pits, where your cart can't go"

THEMES
-caves/underground
-retreat/escape from something else
-organisation of society
-perseverance
