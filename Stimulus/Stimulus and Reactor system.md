Items and the environment can be the source of one or more stimuli. Every element in the game should be one or more kinds of reactor.

Stimuli have a strength. Reactors have a threshold above which a stimulus of some strength will trigger a reaction (additional requirements may be added).

A stimulus can be triggered by:
- proximity (e.g. near heat)
- collision (e.g. hit with kinetic energy)
- consumption (e.g. eating poison)
