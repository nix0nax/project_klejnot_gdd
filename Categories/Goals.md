This page will describe gameplay goals.

## Items placed in the environment should interact frequently
Pillars: interactive environment, discovery, problem solving
Why? This creates many options for discovering new resources and creating emergent gameplay.
## Emergent gameplay should be a priority
Pillars: problem solving, agency, discovery
Why? Emergent gameplay creates interesting possible solutions to problems.
## Every puzzle should have multiple solutions
Pillars: problem solving, agency, discovery
Why? Players should be given the freedom to use all the systems they are given to solve problems. This plays into agency.
## There should be many optional side areas with rewards
Pillars: discovery, agency, oppressive but conquerable
Why? This encourages discovery and lets the player choose if they want to expend extra resources for potential rewards.
## Resources should be scarce but (usually) renewable
Pillars: limited resources, discovery, interactive environment, oppressive but conquerable
Why? Experimentation with crafting is a central component of the game. If the player uses their resources to craft something out of curiosity, they should not be punished. Having to renew resources also makes the environment more interactive.
## There should be many different kinds of consumables
Pillars: agency, discovery, interactive environment, problem solving
Why? Many consumables incentivize experimentation and more approaches to solving problems. They also facilitate emergent environment interactions.
## There should be many paths to your goal
Pillars: discovery, agency
Why? Caves can be complex, we want to avoid the frustration of having to find the exact correct path somewhere. Some paths might also feature obstacles a player is more prepared to handle, giving them more agency in the path they chose.
