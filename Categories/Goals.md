This page will describe gameplay goals.

## Items placed in the environment should interact frequently
Pillars: interactive environment, discovery, problem solving
Why? This creates many options for discovering new resources and creating emergent gameplay.
## Emergent gameplay should be a priority
Pillars: problem solving, agency, discovery
Why? Emergent gameplay creates interesting possible solutions to problems.
## Every puzzle should have multiple solutions
Pillars: problem solving, agency, discovery
Why? Players should be given the freedom to use all the systems they are given to solve problems. This plays into agency.
## There should be many optional side areas with rewards
Pillars: discovery, agency, oppressive but conquerable
Why? This encourages discovery and lets the player choose if they want to expend extra resources for potential rewards.
## There should be many paths to your goal
Pillars: discovery, agency
Why? Caves can be complex, we want to avoid the frustration of having to find the exact correct path somewhere. Some paths might also feature obstacles a player is more prepared to handle, giving them more agency in the path they chose.
## All items should be reusable or "decraftable"
(at least first draft)
Pillars: interactive environment, Limited resources
Why? The player should be allowed to experiment without wasting resources.
