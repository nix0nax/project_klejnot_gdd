# Stages
We will split this project into stages. They are smaller parts of the overall game we want to get to at the end of this. For all intents and purposes after phase 1 (planning) each stage should be considered it's own game/project. Each stage will repeat phases 2, 3 and 4 (pre-production, production, testing).
## Currently planned stages
1. Exploration Stage - core exploration concepts. Ignoring combat and social interaction
2. Combat Stage - focus exclusively on combat
3. Social Stage - focus on social interaction and questing
More stages may be added if we ever get that far

# Phases
## 1. Planning
This phase will NOT repeated after a stage is done. This is where we define the most basic things about the game. The core concepts, design pillars, general setting, elevator pitch...
## 2. Pre-Production
This is where we define the game as much as possible before actively working on it.
Here is what will primarily be worked on in this stage
#### Design
- defining and refining gameplay features
- making the design document
#### Writing
- worldbuilding, fleshing out the setting
- working with designers to make sure the setting and gameplay elements mesh together
#### Art
- defining the look and feel of the visuals (style guidelines)
- [[Concept art]]
- help with mockup sketches for the design document
#### Programming
- prototyping systems to see if they're viable and fun
- making systems that make creating content easier later on (like level builders or whatever)
#### Sound
- define the sound of the game (general guidelines)
- some rough music can be made at this point - think of it as the equivalent of concept art but as music :p
## 3. Production
We will spend most of our time here. This is where the game actually gets made. At this point changes to the game design document should be minimal (or at least low impact). They are not however disallowed. 
If things start going really badly at this stage already (we figure out the game actually just isn't fun prematurely or something) we can go back to pre-production to redefine things. Ideally however we don't do this.
## 4. Testing
Here we test the game for bugs and to see if it's actually... well... fun. If we think we didn't succeed we can go back to the drawing board (pre-production) and repeat phases 2-4. If we did succeed we move on to the next stage.
This is the point where we should really critically examine what works and what doesn't as it will be critical to do more iterations if we aren't satisfied.
