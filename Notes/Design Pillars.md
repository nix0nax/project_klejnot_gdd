# Problem solving
Klejnot primarily challenges the player to think of clever solutions to problems. The goal of the game is not to test the player's mechanical skills.
# Interactive environment
Most things in the environment interact in some way. The environment is in large part shaped by the player over time.
# Discovery
Going off the beaten path is interesting and rewarding. There are many unknowns that can only be learned with exploration. There is always more to discover.
# Oppressive but conquerable
Klejnot is unforgiving but not doomed. Through significant effort any challenge can be overcome, but without that effort the world will swallow you whole.
# Agency
The player has full agency in how to approach problems. Multiple varied solutions exist for every problem.
# Limited resources
There is never an abundance of resources. Everyone must be smart with how they use and acquire what they have as to not doom themselves.
# Isolation(ism)
The feeling of loneliness is ever-present. While societies exist in the world they are cut off from each other. The player does not truly belong to any group.
