# I just want to throw my idea in the document
Read [[How to use this document#What if I want to add my own ideas?|this]] if you don't care about guidelines and just want to put your concept into writing.
# How to obsidian
Everything is written in [[Markdown]]. The only difference is the linking - just use square brackets to link to a page, follow it with a # if you want to link to a part of a page, then follow it with | if you want to change display text.
# Making a page
To make a page press ctrl + o, write a name and press enter.
## What folder to put it in
There are only 4 folders:
- Fleeting - put all your ideas and scribbles here. Feel free to write these wherever - but a screencap or something would be appreciated. Meeting notes and similar should also go here. It can also be an external link (if we used a shared document for a meeting or something like that)
- Notes - these are the actual pages with content. Goals should also go here, not in categories.
- Categories - indexes or empty pages used for linking back to. Writing down an index is done as needed (if it's smaller we can use backlinks instead)
- Pictures - just move your pics here for organizational purposes

# Page (notes) guidelines
- Feel free to ignore this for fleeting notes.
- This is for notes not categories.
## Layout
### Tag
The tag is the main category (tag not tags). You should only use tags from the [[List of tags]].
### Categories
- A page can have many categories.
- They are links to a page in the category folder.
- They should be listed most to least specific.
### Goals
Any gameplay system should state what the goal it is trying to achieve. This should link to a page describing the goal. Create one if none exist but **ask the team first**. Changing a goal is a bigger deal than changing a system (especially if you can define that system's goal :3)
### "See also"
See also is an optional header at the end of a page. You should use it often to link similar concepts that aren't categories.
