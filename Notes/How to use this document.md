This page is here to describe how to use this game design document. You should use Obsidian to view it.
# Where to start?
Here! 
Unless you already know what you're doing, then make a fleeting note or open the [[Table of contents (list of categories)]].
# Pages
A page is what you're on right now! These are **short** documents that describe concepts. 
You can use ctrl + o to look for pages in obsidian. 
If a page is relevant to another page *(e.g. a page describing a crafting system and a page describing an item system.)* it will be backlinked [[How to use this document#Pages|like this.]]
## Tag
A tag is the main category of a page. They are fairly self-explanatory.
## Categories
Categories describe what the page is about. Pages can have multiple categories. Crucially they act as indexes (click on a category and you'll see what I mean).
## Goals
This will usually appear in gameplay related pages but might be found elsewhere. Pages describing a specific system have to describe what the goal of the system is.
# How to find a page
1. Ideally if the page is relevant to the page you're on there should be a link to the relevant page.
2. If you know exactly what you're looking for search for it with ctrl + o.
3. If you can't find it click the most relevant category in the [[Table of contents (list of categories)]]. Work your way from there!
4. Bother Miš about it.
# What if I want to add my own ideas?
You should only really do this during pre-production (ask Miš if unsure).

If you don't want to bother with following the guidelines of how this document is set up (and let's be real you probably don't) just make a new note in the "Fleeting" folder. Write down whatever scribbles you want (or just link to an external document) and don't bother with formatting them.
After you're done bother Miš about it. If you've done a lot they'll probably contact you for a short meeting (my favorite) to make sure your ideas were translated into this document correctly.

If you actually want to bother doing it yourself read [[How to edit this document (guidelines)]].
